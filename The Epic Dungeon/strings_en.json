["CityOfTears_Story","Every archaeologist, adventurer or traveler in this world once wished to visit this legendary city, but alas!, getting here is certainly not easy. This is the city of tears, a civilization that grew and flourished underground and that possesses ancient knowledge of the ancient evils that once threatened this world. For centuries, it remained hidden and its contact with the surface ended long ago. Probably they did not want to interfere or get involved in matters they had nothing to do with or they simply decided to conceal the knowledge they accumulated over decades and decades. After all, not everyone in the surface has good intentions. Consider this is probably the only haven of peace you might spot down here, so prepare yourself before going any further."]

["Goo_Story","The further levels of this dungeon path consist almost entirely of sticky, inky flesh. No one really knows the reason why that absurdly huge amount of dark miasma has accumulated here. Scholars and 'ink wizards' speculate that the cause might be the presence of underground pools of that inky liquid lying over a very hot environment. Those who dared to venture through here never came back, this is your chance to solve the mystery!"]
["HellCastle_Story","Located very close to the very centre of the world, this subterranean fortress looks very imposing from outside and very dangerous from inside. This inmense castle was made by an ancient god who legends tell it came from another dimension where magic is much more notable and present than in this one. He and his army of creatures that soon began to be called 'demons' fought against the nearest civilization, so the war between dwarves and demons start. At a very high cost, dwarves managed to capture the old god and imprision him in an unknown place, deep on this fortress. Centuries and centuries passed, and the once dwarven empire is now in chaos. Do not expect an easy travelling down here, as probably the remains of the demon army have made their presence strong here."]
["IceCastle_Story","Centuries ago, in the heat of the decisive battle between dwarves and demons, the King of Dwarves decided to use one of the most powerful artifacts they possessed if not their most powerful one. At the cost of a huge amount of magic and many dwarves' lives, the king's crown got imbued into an extreme elemental magic known as antientropic or, vulgary speaking, 'ice magic'. After the battle, the crown ended up lost and no dwarf managed to find it, but some decades ago just after dwarves sealed themselves in their metropolis, unrelenting rays of ice bursted from the depths of the kobold caves, practically erradicating their civilisation and estabilishing a new order. Regarding what really happened, it's unknown, but it certainly has to do with the lost crown of the dwarf king. It would not be surprising at all if this impressive fortress was also made by the crown user."]
["Ice_Story","In the coldest caves of the dungeon kobolds found their home. They were not an aggresive race. Unlike gnoll tribes which never really went further from a basic knowledge magic and polearm weapons, they accumulated knowledge and learned ice magic. The kobolds once flourished by selling ice wands and artifacts, and trading some fossils with scholars and archaeologists in the surface. However, with the fall of the dwarves their civilisation declined and it is said that something catastrophic happened to them just after that."]
["MagicCaves_Story","Incredibly beautiful and varied crystal formations cover up the entire galleries up to where your glance reaches. It is clear that no human has ever set foot here; there are no registries, notes, diaries or any other kind of information about these caves, and that potentially makes them more dangerous. Beware!"]
["Necro_Story","Many necromancers and adventurers have come to seek their destiny in Necropolis, the ancient underground city where the own death is said to dwell.

["Night_Story","The outskirts of the majestic dwarf city where noblemen had their residences; magnificent lanes with glowing lanes, beautiful gardens, resting zones...All of those were sacked, razed by the demon army during Yog-Dzewa's invasion of the dwarven kingdom. The war ended centuries ago, and this place is now haunted by creatures from the dimension of nightmares where the old God was supposed to come from. They survived by feeding on the fear of unlucky dwarves they subdued."]

["Shadow_Story","Mysterious corridors of dark bricks beneath the necropolis conceal a secret of their origin. Researchers and scholars speculate that they were built by dwarves, but there's not consensus. Some magicians assure that the stones used to make these walls are very similar to some fortress located down in the ice caves."]
["Skeleton_Story","One of the generals of the demon army was exiled to this place. The outbuildings of the great city on the upper floors have been slowly transformed into a fortress of tin-plated, very hard bricks. The magic that soaks in this place is relatively different from other kinds of demon magic you've experimented."]
["Spider_Story","Once this place was part of a vast fortress built by the old God itself. He made his way up until he stumbled upon the dwarves. The war started and dwarves managed to overpower Yog and his demon army. This place is now part of the no man's land, no civilization seemingly made home after the war. As a consequence, a colony of grim arthropods settled inside the ruins and part of the inky liquid slowly dripped up here."]

["DworfTown_Story","After the war, not all the dwarves were wiped out despite the high cost in terms of lives it had got. The surviving dwarves escaped to the caves, where they founded and built a city. Similar small cities are spread all over the dungeon in secret places, and all of them are far away enough from the surface to not raise any kind of interest to the townspeople there."]
["Bandit_Story","One day a king wanted to build himself a magnificent castle, inside a mountain. Thousands of workers carried stone blocks on their backs day and night. When the magnificent structure was ready, there was a sudden tremor inside the rock. In a few moments the huge rock crumbled under the ground. Centuries later, the remains of this underground structure served as the prison which is now abandoned."]
["Light_Story","Archaeologists are always arguing about what this part of the dungeon is. Some say it is another city of dwarves, while others speak of ancient creatures that lived in the area. The walls of this underground city are made of carved white stone, mainly granite and marble."]
["Library_Story","Probably the most interesting place for any mage. The Dwarf library was once a place of knowledge and wisdom.
